I made this assistant in python personalised to me and my laptop.

I also made an automation for it to run, which uses the  microphone to listen if its name is called out and then asks for authentication; only then does it boot up.

It can play my playlist on Spotify, message my friends on Instagram, and WhatsApp call.

Opening and closing of apps, searching Wikipedia for information, telling jokes, taking a screenshot, telling me the temperature, translating from Hindi to English, and much more.



## This is the GUI window that opens up after authentication

In this project, I learnt to implement many libraries in python.
This is a basic assistant without any use of neural networks and works completely on your speech and matching that against a set of keywords and using extensive else if ladder to perform a task assigned to the keyword.
