I made this assistant in python personalised to me and my laptop.

I also made an automation for it to run, which uses the  microphone to listen if I call out its name and then asks me for passcode, only then boots up.
#
It can play my playlist on Spotify, message my friends on Instagram, and WhatsApp.
#
Opening and closing of apps, searching Wikipedia for information, telling jokes, taking a screenshot, telling me the temperature, translating from Hindi to English, and much more



## This is the gui window that opens up after authenication
